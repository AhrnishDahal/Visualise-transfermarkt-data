Player data json forked from hrmtsh2/top_250_players_data

All visualisations in BokehJS because the plots look clean and are interactive (although a little complex compared to seaborn and mpl)

I have only included simple visualisations that include-
 a) Age-wise distribution of players in the Top 250 list
 b) Team-wise distribution of players in the Top 250 list
 c) Market value-wise distribution of players in the Top 250 list
 d) Age vs Market-value study for 6 samples of 20 random players
 e) Age distribution by position
